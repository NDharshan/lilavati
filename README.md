# Demonstration of Indian Knowledge Systems in Astronomy and Mathematics 

This project attempts to study the work Lilavati by Bhaskaracharya and understand the algorithms he presents from the contemporary light of Mathematics and Astronomy.
Some of these algorithms are unique while some pioneered the field, which were later worked on by other scientists most notably the Pell's equation and its solution
This was built as Mini Project in the Course of Advanced Java 2023

# The Algorithms we consider
* Square root
* Cube root
* Kuttaka method of solving equations

# Technology Stack
## Swing GUI
* Swing
* AWT 

# Getting started with code
`javac Main.java && java Main`

# Working and Structure
* About - Brief about the project
* View - view selected shlokas and run selected verses live
* Background Information - Information about Bhaskaracharya

# Contents of Lilavati discussed
We study the contents of Lilavati through the following headers for the ease of understanding of a cursory reader familiar with Modern Mathematics 
* __Fundamental Operations__
* __Fractions__
* __On Infinity and Eight rules of Zero__
* __Reverse process and the concept of limits__
* __Ratio and Proportions__
* __Simple Interest, Progressions__
* __Algebra__
* __Squares and Cubes__
* __Trigonometry and Geometry__
* __Mensuration of Polygons and other objects__
* __Volume__
* __Discrete Mathematics__
